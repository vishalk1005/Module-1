# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Finding Speed of a Car

## AIM
To write a program to find speed of the car to cover the given distance(km) and time(hr).
## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Input the distance traveled (in kilometers) as a float.
3. Input the time taken (in hours) as a float.
4. Calculate the speed using the formula: speed = distance / time
5. Display the speed formatted to two decimal places in the form of "Speed is X km/hr".
6. Terminate the program.
## PROGRAM
```python
dist=float(input())
time=float(input())
speed=dist/time
print("Speed is {:.2f}km/hr".format(speed))
```
